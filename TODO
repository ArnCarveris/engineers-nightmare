# TODO

* need to decide on consistent terminology for differentiating between the various co-ordinate systems (e.g. chunk co-ords, block co-ords relative to sub_space, block co-ords within chunk)
* decide on how to handle error signalling within C++ style constructors
* consider usage of DEBUG and printf within grid_3d
