# TODO

* need to decide on consistent terminology for differentiating between the various co-ordinate systems (e.g. chunk co-ords, block co-ords relative to sub_space, block co-ords within chunk)
* consider usage of DEBUG and printf within grid_3d
* document grid_3d extension in doc/ (diagrams required)
* implemented remaining extend cases:

    * x high
    * x low
    * y high
    * y low
    * z low
